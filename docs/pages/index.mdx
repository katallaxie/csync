# csync

`csync` is a tool to backup your settings using common cloud storage solutions like [iCloud Drive](https://www.icloud.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/de/drive/) or any other file system based sync solution.

[Installation](/csync/installation) is super easy. You can initialize a config via `csync --init` your home directory.

```yaml
version: 1
provider:
  name: icloud
```
